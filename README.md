	- CRC algorithm
	- Check ISO image from disk
##How to get
S Checker is available from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Klanz/s-checker/releases) page in this GitHub repo.

Currently it is only available as a Bash script or in binary version for x64 Linux systems.
##Usage
S Checker is run from the command line, first specifying the algorithm or the program option, then inputting the file and then, the provided checksum.

For full usage information, type 
`schecker -h` or `schecker --help`

# S Checker
S Checker allows you to easily check if a file of yours matches its provided checksum. It does so by combining the existing checksum computing utilities in a GNU/Linux OS with an easy command line interface.
##Features
- Multiple checksum algorithms
	- MD5
	- SHA1
	- SHA256
	- SHA512
- Check ISO image from disk
	
##How to get S Checker
S Checker is available from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/albertaparicio/s-checker/releases) page in this GitHub repository.

Currently it is only available as a Bash script or in binary version for x64 GNU/Linux systems (old versions).
##Usage
S Checker is run from the command line, first specifying the algorithm or the program option, then inputting the file and then, the provided checksum or filename:

`Usage: schecker [[[-m]|[-s1]|[-s2]|[-s5]|[-i]] [-f filename] [[-c checksum]|[-d device]]|[-h]]`

For full usage information, type 
`schecker -h` or `schecker --help`
